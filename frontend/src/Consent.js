          Suppose someone is just moving to your town and wants to check out
          some restaurants. Pick <b>two restaurants</b> that you think{" "}
          <b>they should visit</b> and <b>one</b> that you think{" "}
          <b>they should avoid</b>. As part of this study, you will write reviews
          of the three restaurants that convince your reader to go, or not go.<br />
          <br />
          Bonuses are available for especially persuasive writing!

    <p>
      We are studying systems that offer shortcuts while someone is typing to
      find out how the system's design affects the writing process, writing
      outcome, and the author's subjective experience, and how psychological
      factors may influence those effects.

    <p>
      You will type a few paragraphs of text, using keyboards that give various
      kinds of help in the process. You should not include any personally
      identifiable information in what you write.
    </p>
    <p>
      There will be questionnaires throughout the study, which may include
      questions about your age, gender, personality, computer use, and other
      demographic information.

    <p>
      Some aspects of this study will occur at your own pace, so the time
      commitment may vary, but we expect it to be{" "}

      break about every 5 minutes.

        The MTurk platform provides access to your worker ID, which in some
        cases can be mapped to your name and work history. We are relying on the
        security of that platform to maintain your confidentiality. To partially
        mitigate the risk of re-identification, we will assign you a random
        identifier specific to this study and delete the mapping between this
        identifier and your worker ID 6 months after the experiment concludes.
        But if the security of the MTurk platform or our account is breached, it
        may be possible to re-identify your work, as with any MTurk task.{" "}
